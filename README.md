## CalMate - A Fitness Tracking App which counts calories.

## The project developers

The project is developed by the second-year Information Technology students from Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
In the fourth period of our second year study we got the opportunity to work on a Mobile Development Project(CalMate). We tried our best to fullfil all the reqirements of the project. 
It was fun and at the same time challenging to impliment all the functionality of the project but at the end we have accomplished the project through teamwork.
